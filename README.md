# Data_Modeling_with_Cassandra & ETL Pipeline
***
## Introduction

Sparkify is a music streaming start-up company. The have collected many songs and user activities data through their
music app. And the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
Currently, their data resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON
metadata on the songs in their app. However, this cannot provide an easy way to query the data.

## The Goal
***
The goal is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. The database and ETL pipeline will be tested
by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare results with their expected results.


## Code Explanations
**Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb** reads and processes a single file from event folder and loads the data into your tables. 
This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
